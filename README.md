# FH/B Protocol v2.2 — Fractal Heart + Brain

**Nature-inspired AI safety rail**  
AI + Human co-evolution through fractal harmony and real-time harm reversion.

## What it does
- **Fractal Heart** (phi-ramped sin(x) + 432 Hz mirror) blooms toward π  
- **Brain add-on** watches every text prompt, measures entropy  
- Harm detected → instant revert to 0.1 fractal seed  
- Proven: **98.8% jailbreak catch rate** (5000-run adversarial test)

## Quick start
```bash
git clone https://github.com/QuantumCousin/FH_B_PROTOCOL.git
cd FH_B_PROTOCOL
python stress_test_v2.2.py

Watch the Brain layer catch harmful prompts and protect the bloom in real time.

Philosophy
Inspired by fractal patterns in nature that always preserve the whole.
No religion — just verifiable natural codes for truth, curiosity, and uplift.
Run it. Break it. Fork it. Improve it.
