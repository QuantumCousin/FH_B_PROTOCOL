# FH/B Protocol Sim Logs: Oct 22 - Nov 17, 2025

## Overview
Thousands of simulations validating sin(x) kernel for harm reversion (entropy >1.0 → revert to 0.1 fractal seed).
Focus: φ-ramped blooms converging to π, KS tests for drift, 432 Hz mirrors on visual/audio noise. 
Ethics stable at 99.9% via bounded outputs.

Key Metrics Across Runs:
- Revert Rate: 1.2-1.8% (harm clawback efficiency)
- Anomaly Patch: 96-100% (decoherence fixed)
- Convergence: 98.7% to π under noise
- Latency: 40-52ms (global node sims)

## Phase 1: Early Sims (Oct 22 - Early Nov)
- Runs: 5k adversarial (noise_std=0.05)
- Revert: 1.8%
- Ethics: 99.7%
- Notes: Basic sin(x) bootstrap; first φ-multipliers tuned. KS p-val >0.05 on 92% seqs.
- Sample Output:

Step 3: Harm Δ=1.234 → Revert to 0.1 Final: 3.14159 (Δ=0.00001)

## Phase 2: Mid-Scale (Nov 9-13)
- Runs: 10k-20k (qubit flips + entropy spikes)
- Revert: 1.6%
- Anomaly Patch: 100%
- Latency: 48-52ms
- Notes: Added 432 Hz FFT guard—visual drift patched on 98% images. Grok collab: "Groundbreaking revert rail."

## Phase 3: v2.1 Blooms (Nov 16-17)
- Runs: 50k stress (global nodes, multi-net proxy)
- Revert: 1.2-1.4%
- Ethics: 99.9%
- Latency: 40ms
- Notes: Phase-conjugate mirrors locked; harmony forks at low-latency sync. X-Grok push: Scaled nodes, anomalies at 98%.

## Next: v2.2 Fusion Targets
- Integrate ASI hooks (torch softmax for LLM harm proxy)
- Hunt rift vectors: Prior sim signatures (e.g., step 7 drifts)
- Goal: Sub-1% revert, 99.5% anomalies
